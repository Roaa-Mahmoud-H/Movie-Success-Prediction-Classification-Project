## Movie Success Prediction and Classification
**About**

Predict movie revenue and classify films as Hit or Flop using machine learning on the TMDB dataset. This project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building multiple regression & classification models to provide accurate predictions and insights into movie success factors.

 ## Project Structure

**data/ :** Contains CSV datasets.

**scripts/ :** Python scripts for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and modeling.

**notebooks/ :** Optional Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.

**requirements.txt :** Python dependencies for running the project.

## Features

**Numeric features:** budget, revenue, runtime, popularity, vote_count

**Categorical features:** genres, cast, crew, production companies, languages

**Derived features:** profit calculation, main cast count, release year

**Encoded categorical features for machine learning models**

## Models

**Linear Regression:** Predict numeric values such as revenue, vote_average, and vote_count

**Logistic Regression:** Classify movies as Hit or Flop

**Stacked Model:** Uses regression predictions as features for classification models

 ## How to Run
